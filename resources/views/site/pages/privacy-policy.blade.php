In addition to managing the appropriate routing of information, we use so-called “cookies,” “web beacons,” “server logs” and other Engagement Tools (“Engagement Tools”) to enhance the quality of the service and content you receive. For example, we use Engagement Tools to: </span></p>

                        <p class="p2"><span class="s1">Therefore, even if you do not register with us or submit any personal information on our Site, our Engagement Tools automatically receive information about your Device and the software running on it. We call such information Engagement Data (“Engagement Data”).</span></p>
                        <p>Engagement Data often includes elements such as the date and time a “request” is made, the model of the Device making the “request,” the type and version of operating system running on a Device, the browser making the request, routing information, IP address, geolocation, search terms a User enters, what URL a Device most recently visited, and, if a mobile application is used, an anonymous unique number. Engagement Data can also include Internet or other electronic network activity information, including, but not limited to, browsing history, search history, and information regarding a consumer’s interaction with an Internet website, application, or advertisement. Engagement Data can be combined with personal information. If so, we treat such combined information the same way we treat personal information.</p>
                        <p>You have the ability to control how certain Engagement Tools operate by modifying the settings on your Device or its software. Most browsers, for example, allow you to refuse accepting cookies, and many mobile Devices allow you to disable the sending of location information. In some cases, doing these things could diminish the performance of our Site and Services or render them inoperable. To learn more about Engagement Tools and how we use Engagement Data please see the section below entitled “How Information is Used.”</p>
                        <p><b>Do Not Track Disclosures </b></p>
                        <p>Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services (e.g., browser “do not track” signals). Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.</p>
                        <p><b>Online Tracking By Third Parties </b></p>
                        <p>Third-party analytics and other service providers, such as Google Analytics, may set and access their own tracking technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you and track you over time and across third party websites. These service providers use tracking technologies to help us analyze how visitors use our Site and Services. We are not responsible for those third party technologies or activities arising out of them. However, some third parties may offer you certain choices regarding their practices.</p>

                        <p>We work with certain third parties who deploy their own Engagement Tools on our Site (“Third Party Tools”). In some instances they do so exclusively on our behalf. In other instances, they may retain and use the data they collect pursuant to publicly available privacy policies. These Third Party Tools are frequently deployed by companies providing online advertising services or analytics, but they may be deployed in other contexts as well, such as social media plug-ins. We treat personal and non-personal information that we receive from these Third Party Tools the same way we treat personal and non-personal information that we directly collect from our Site. We, however, do not control how these third parties manage the information they gather.</p>

                        <p>Information you submit to us that identifies you or can be used to contact you (e.g., email or mailing address) is your “personal information.” We collect the following categories of personal information about you:</p>

                        <p><b>IV. CONSENTS AND AUTHORIZATIONS. </b></p>
                        <p>From time to time, we may request your consent or authorization (your “consent”) in connection with the use or sharing of your information. In some instances, this will be because your User Agreement, this Privacy Policy or applicable law or regulations requires us to obtain such consent. In other instances, such consent will be for informational purposes. In the latter case, the request to obtain your consent should not be interpreted as narrowing the scope or applicability of your User Agreement or this Privacy Policy – by entering into your User Agreement or using the applicable Services, you have accepted and agreed to our information handling practices in the manner described in your User Agreement and this Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p>In cases where you consent or “opt-in” to the use or sharing of your personal information in a manner that is not otherwise provided for in your User Agreement or this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise explicitly stated in such consent, you will have the ability to rescind your consent and “opt-out” of our use or sharing of such information in the future. In that event, we will refrain from our use or sharing of such information, but we may not be able to require the removal of such information from the databases of the recipients with whom such information has been shared.</p>
                        <p><b>V. SERVICE EMAILS AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS. </b></p>
                        <p>Our Site and/or Services allow Users to communicate with others through our in-product instant messaging services, Service-branded emails, SMS and other electronic communication channels. Communications that are sent by or on behalf of a User are indicated as being “From” that User. Communications that are sent by us are indicated as being from us or one of our account or support specialists assigned to assist you. Either type of communications may be “real time” communications or communications triggered automatically upon the occurrence of certain events or dates – such as a repeated sign-in failure, an appointment reminder and the like.</p>
                        <p><b>Email communications </b></p>
                        <p>Electronic messages received from Users and our administrative announcements are often transactional or relationship messages, such as appointment requests, reminders and cancellations and other Service notifications. You may not be able to opt out of receiving certain messages, although our Site and/or Services may provide a means to modify the frequency of receiving them. In cases in which we believe User emails are not primarily transactional or relationship messages, it will include the capability to opt-out of receiving further e-mails. If you sign-up to receive marketing announcements from us, such emails will include capability to opt-out of receiving such e-mails in the future.</p>
                        <p>On occasion, we will communicate marketing information, operational updates and other information to Users via electronic mail. Users agree that such transmissions are important means of communication between us and Users and shall not be considered junk faxes or unsolicited advertisements as defined by the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 or other applicable state or federal laws or regulation.</p>
                        <p><b>Surveys </b></p>
                        <p>From time to time we ask Users to complete surveys or otherwise provide input to improve our operations or to assist other Users in making informed choices. The content of such surveys, therefore, should be presumed public. When we make such survey, we let Users know how their responses will be used. As with communities and public forums, we strongly advise Users to exercise care in selecting what information they share in a survey or similar communication, and strongly recommend against sharing any personal financial or other sensitive information that could directly or indirectly be traced to any individual, including yourself.</p>

                        <p>Our Site may deploy Engagement Tools (such as “cookies,” “web beacons” and “server logs”) on outbound emails to Users and others to collect Engagement Data, and we may use vendors to assist us in sending outbound emails to Users who may deploy Third Party Tools.</p>

If, for example, you respond to a posted job opening, that communication to us is not covered by this Privacy Policy as we utilize a third party service provider to manage the application process for the job openings that may have been posted on our Site. Likewise, if you submit to us any ideas, suggestions or proposals (collectively, “Suggestions”) relating to our Site or Services or other products or services by any means – such as through email or other communication channels, one of our communities or user forums, or to our customer support or other personnel – such Suggestions are not governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>

                        <p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>VII. THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING OUR SITE, SERVICES AND THE INFORMATION THEY SAFEGUARD. </b></span></p>
                        <p>Our Site and many of our Services are protected by technical measures intended to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of sensitive information our Users store and share on our Site. Further, certain regulations require us to investigate potential or suspected threats on our Services or the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information they safeguard. Accordingly, we may preserve, use and disclose information – including personal and non-personal information – when we have a good faith belief it is necessary or advisable to:</p>
                        <ol class="ol1">
                        <li class="li4"><span class="s1">Detect, prevent and address potential or suspected: threats on our Site or Services or the confidentiality, integrity or availability of any information they house; fraud and other illegal activity; or violations of our User Agreements or Terms of Use; and </span></li>

                        </ol>
                        <p class="p4"><span class="s1">We may also preserve, use and disclose such information in response to a search warrant, court order, subpoena, judicial proceeding or other legal process if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Such legal process may prohibit us from notifying the Users or other individuals or entities identified by such information or take such other actions as would otherwise be a violation of your User Agreement or this Privacy Policy. When we preserve information pursuant to this section, it may be for extended periods of time, as we in good faith believe are necessary or appropriate under the circumstances, and may include the preservation of information from accounts that have been disabled.</span></p>
                        <p><b>VIII. SECURITY. </b></p>
                        <p>We endeavor to make security of our Site and Services and the information they collect, store, process and transmit a top priority. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of the information we collect, we deploy a wide range of technical, physical and administrative safeguards, including: Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, firewalls, system alerts and other information system security technologies; housing data in secure facilities that restrict physical and network access; and regular evaluation and enhancement of our information technology systems, facilities, and information collection, storage and processing practices. It is important to remember, however, that no system can guarantee 100% security at all times. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of information stored on or transmitted to or from our Site and Services.</p>
                        <p><strong><span class="s4">Steps You Can Take</span></strong></p>
                        <p>If we learn of a security vulnerability or risk, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective measures you may take. There are, however, some precautions that you can proactively take to improve your system security and reduce the likelihood of unintended disclosure of personal information:</p>
                        <ol class="ol1">
                        <li class="li4"><span class="s1">Install malware detection programs that regularly scan your system and incoming traffic for malicious code – such as computer viruses, worms, Trojan Horses and spyware. Because viruses and malware are continuously created and modified, regular malware protection software typically requires frequent updates. </span></li>
                        <li class="li4"><span class="s1">Use a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to your Device. </span></li>
                        <li class="li4"><span class="s1">Because malware often targets vulnerabilities in existing operating systems, browsers, plug-ins and other programs, software vendors frequently update their products with security patches to guard against known or commonly exploited vulnerabilities. Vendors often try to alert their users and recommend immediate installation of these security patches. </span></li>
                        <li class="li4"><span class="s1">Use a strong password using a combination of letters and numbers that are not easily guessed. Do not share your password with others. </span></li>
                        <li class="li4"><span class="s1">If you use a shared Device, always close all active programs and log out before leaving it unattended. </span></li>
                        <li class="li4"><span class="s1">Avoid using a public wireless network, if possible. If you do use a public network, use the most restrictive wireless network settings on your Device. </span></li>
                        <li class="li4"><span class="s1">If you use file-sharing programs, be sure to restrict all other folders or directories to “no share.” </span></li>
                        <li class="li4"><span class="s1">Be very cautious with any email requesting you to share personal information. On websites, look for the lock symbol on or near your browser’s address bar which signifies a secure website before supplying personal information. </span></li>
                        <li class="li4"><span class="s1">When participating in one of our communities, blogs, forums, surveys or other open communication platforms, exercise care in selecting what information you share, particularly personal or financial information. </span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>IX. CHILDREN UNDER 13. </b></span></p>
                        <p>Our Site and Services are not intended for or designed to attract children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from such children. If we learn that we have inadvertently obtained personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as soon as practicable. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us immediately at the contact information below. Should this Privacy Policy change, we would comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which requires us to notify and obtain consent from a parent or guardian before we collect, use and disclose the personal information of children who are under 13 years of age.</p>
                        <p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, our Site and Services do allow Users above the age of 18 years old – such as parents and guardians – to submit personal information about others, including minors. Such Users assume full responsibility over their submission, use and transmission of such information.</p>
                        <p><b>X. UNITED STATES ONLY. </b></p>
                        <p>Access to our Site and Services is administered in the United States (“US”) and are intended for Users in the US. You may not use our Site or Services in any jurisdiction where offering, accessing or using our Site or Services would be illegal or unlawful. If you are located outside of the US, please note that the information you submit to us will be transferred to the US. By using our Site and/or Services, you consent to this transfer. You also consent to the transfer to and processing of any personal information by us or any of the other parties described in the section “Sharing of Information” above, whether located in the US or any other countries, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or for any other specific purposes to which you consent. If you are located in a country other than the US, you should note that, at present, the laws of the US and certain other countries have not been approved by the European Commission or privacy authorities in certain other countries as providing “adequate protection” for personal information within the meaning of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation or applicable laws of other countries.</p>
                        <p><b>XI. THIRD PARTY SERVICES. </b></p>
                        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to our Site and Services. It does not apply to services offered by third parties, including websites and other online services that our Site or Services may display links to or advertisements for. When you click on such links or advertisements, you will be visiting websites or interactive services operated by third parties, who have their own information collection practices and may also collect information through the use of tracking tools, such as cookies, web beacons, server logs and the like. When you click on or interact with an ad appearing in our Site or Services, the advertiser or sponsor may infer that you meet targeting criteria that they may have used in connection with the sponsoring such ad. This may lead to similar ads being targeted to you on our Site or Services or elsewhere. We do not have control over how any third party gathers or uses information, so you should review their privacy policies to learn of their information gathering and handling practices.</p>
                        <p><b>XII. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY. </b></p>
                        <p>We continue to improve and enhance our Site and Services. Some of these improvements and enhancements may result in changes to this Privacy Policy. We will post such changes along on this page, and if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. Because our Privacy Policy can change at any time, we encourage you to reread it periodically to see if there have been any changes that affect you. We will post the dated that the Privacy Policy was “Last Updated” for your reference. Any changes to the Privacy Policy will go into effect as soon as they are posted to the Site. If you disagree with any changes to this Privacy Policy and do not wish your information to be subject to the revised Privacy Policy, you will need to deactivate your account before the new Privacy Policy becomes effective. Your use of our Site or Services following any such change constitutes your agreement that all information collected from or about you through our Site or Services after the revised Privacy Policy is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p><b>XIII. VIEWING, UPDATING AND DEACTIVATING INFORMATION. </b></p>
                        <p>Our Site and Services aim to provide you with access to the personal information you submit and the means to update it. This can be accomplished by logging into our Site or Services or contacting us using the contact information below. Under certain circumstances, we may ask you to verify your identity before your request is processed. This will be done free of charge except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).</p>
                        <p>If you desire to deactivate your account please contact us using the contact information below. Upon your request, your account will be deactivated and your personal information will be securely archived. We retain archived information for a period of five years (or longer as permitted by law) as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements and other authorized uses under this Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p>You should also be aware that we store indefinitely non-personal information, including Engagement Data and de-identified personal information, as well as all information that you have shared on any of our public forums, blogs, communities, surveys and the like.</p>
